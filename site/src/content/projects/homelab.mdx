My repo for my homelab and personal device running NixOS.

I use containers to run my services including:

- [This website!](https://github.com/pixel-87/ed-thomas.dev) - Built with Astro
- [Flux](https://fluxcd.io/) - GitOps for the website
- [Traefik](https://traefik.io/) - A reverse proxy and load balancer
- [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) - Home automation platform
- [n8n](https://n8n.io/) - An automation tool
- [Minecraft Server](https://github.com/itzg/docker-minecraft-server) - A Minecraft server for me and my friends
- [Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org/) - A media server
- [Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net/) - A network-wide ad blocker
- [Unbound](https://unbound.net/) - A validating, recursive, caching DNS resolver

I currently run most of these on my Ubuntu Server (an old laptop), but am gradually migrating them to my K3s cluster (A single node old desktop PC).

Once all the services are migrated, the laptop will be added as a second node to the cluster.

The repo also contains my personal NixOS configs for my laptop, where I am attempting to daily drive NixOS.
