I do surveys on prolific.com to make a bit of extra cash, but it has rewards in both dollars and pounds.

So when hunting for the best reward/hour, it can sometimes be confusing on which of £10 or $11.50 is better.

So I vibe coded this extension that adds a / £X.XX (or whatever currency you want) if a survey is not in your desired currency.

It gets the current exchange rate from a free api and caches it with a TTL of one day.

I wrote more about it in a [blog post](/blog/vibe-coding-purpose-built-personal-tools).
